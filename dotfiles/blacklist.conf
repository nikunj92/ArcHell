# Block legacy or conflicting GPU drivers

# Intel DDX driver (deprecated, not Wayland-compatible)
# blacklist i915
# ^ ONLY blacklist if you're absolutely replacing with modesetting everywhere.

blacklist nouveau
options nouveau modeset=0

# VMware guest GPU (if using passthrough or native GPU instead)
# blacklist vmwgfx

# Old framebuffer drivers
