# R Whats going on
 * Got a working root - there is a few bugs in the dot files - need to make my repo source of truth updated with the source of truth in by arch
 * Went and loaded the graphics with X11 - super finicky - installed a bunch of crap - lets roll back to base system.
 * Next power control set up - prevent laptop from melting.
 * Install wayland
 * Add GUI

 ## NOTES
    Kernel Command Line for UKI:
    Remember to create /etc/kernel/cmdline inside the chroot. For the NVIDIA hybrid setup, consider adding nvidia-drm.modeset=1 to this file, along with quiet splash if desired. Example for /etc/kernel/cmdline: root=UUID=ROOT_PARTITION_UUID rootflags=subvol=@ rw quiet splash nvidia-drm.modeset=1

    Would be good to clean up the scripts too!
