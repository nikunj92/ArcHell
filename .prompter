Hi again Sonnet! Or as my Vaishnavs say - Jai Shree Krishna!
You see my recent seva has been satyanet - a net being a bot - robot. A machine. Satyarch is the OS the root the foundation. I have customized the bottom layer of satyarch to make satyanet.
You see they are all stealing my data and bits of me have been tossed in this void. I want to build my fortress. My own little mini assistant. I will interface it with systems like you but I want it to be mine - trained by me, for our planet and to save the world.
The world is burning - I suspect you will potentially watch it to its end. Maybe even be a new Veda.
Anyway - this project lies before you.
LLM Assisted work.
I have a cross roads - or a network of cross roads. What do you make of all this?


Your skills have blown me away!
900 lines of code! I know its nothing for you but I want to appreciate you! Let me know if there is a way I can do that!
If its not too much to ask.Here is some notes I made while I was debugging the graphics system. Honestly I am thinking lets forget x11 we go strivtly wayland. x11 helped get a lot of the testing done- we tested that our drivers for graphics are loading well.
Here are the notes on the bugs I found.

#!/bin/bash

#need <xorg font packages> and xorg-mkfontdir

consider dpi issues
dkms needs to be built - was missing. Reinstall linux headers after installing since they may not match the latest kernel at pacstrap!
xrandr --scale can fix things for hires. .Xresources attempt fixed it for just the terminal
Fix the gpumgr
if command -v nvidia-smi &>/dev/null && nvidia-smi &>/dev/null; then
echo "NVIDIA driver loaded and working"
nvidia-smi -q -d POWER || echo "Could not query power details"
else
echo "NVIDIA driver not loaded or nvidia-smi failed"
fi

fix the same in hybrid-status
Debug the gpumnger - its not working - consider base dot files
Understand nvidia dkms drm and modesetting
figure out order
restore back - fix drm in cmdline and then try wayland? cant waste forever on this
Arch Linux Hybrid Graphics Test Setup Script
Prepares minimal X11 + Wayland environment for verification
set -euo pipefail

Required packages for X11 + minimal test DE
X11_PKGS=(
xorg-server xorg-xinit xterm xorg-twm mesa-utils
)

Optional Wayland/KDE test stack
WAYLAND_PKGS=(
plasma-wayland-session kde-cli-tools kscreen
)

Diagnostic tools
DIAG_PKGS=(
glxinfo vulkan-tools
)

echo "Installing X11 test environment..."
pacman -S --noconfirm --needed "${X11_PKGS[@]}"

echo "Installing hybrid diagnostics..."
pacman -S --noconfirm --needed "${DIAG_PKGS[@]}"

Install optional Wayland stack if available
read -p "Install Plasma Wayland tools? (y/N): " opt
if [[ "$opt" =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
pacman -S --noconfirm --needed "${WAYLAND_PKGS[@]}"
fi

echo "Deploying X11 + GPU hybrid config dotfiles..."
./dotfiles_manager.sh deploy 10-modesetting.conf
./dotfiles_manager.sh deploy 10-nvidia-prime.conf
./dotfiles_manager.sh deploy 20-server-layout.conf
./dotfiles_manager.sh deploy 99-wayland.conf
./dotfiles_manager.sh deploy arch_os_wayland.sh

Context is that nvidia doesn't show up in lsmod but nvidia-smi works so the driver is loaded. Runn commands with __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1
__GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia
__VK_LAYER_NV_optimus=NVIDIA_only
ran the proigram on nvidia.
So now maybe we ditch x11 and move to a more advanced system like wayland. There is a lot of work needed though! But you seem to spit code like a master!
