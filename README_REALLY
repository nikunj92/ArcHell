# READ_NOW

This is a comprehensive and well-organized set of scripts and configuration files for a new Arch Linux installation. Here's some feedback:

Strengths:

Modularity: You've broken down the installation process into logical scripts, which is excellent for organization and reusability.
Automation: The scripts automate many tedious parts of an Arch install, especially partitioning, pacstrapping, and Secure Boot setup.
Hardware Specificity: The configurations and package lists in pacstrapper.sh are tailored for your Alienware m18, which should lead to a smoother setup.
Btrfs and Subvolumes: Your use of Btrfs with subvolumes (partitions.sh, mounter.sh, README_OR_DONT.md) is well-planned for snapshots and organization.
Secure Boot Handling: The scripts for key generation (secureboot_keygen.sh), signing (sbsign_helper.sh), and key enrollment assistance (keytool_helper.sh) are thorough.
UKI and systemd-boot: The plan for Unified Kernel Images with systemd-boot is a modern and clean approach.
Documentation: README_OR_DONT.md is a very detailed personal plan, and README.md provides a good overview.
Dotfiles: The dotfiles directory is well-organized with relevant configurations for Xorg, Wayland, mkinitcpio, and bootloader entries.
Areas for Attention & Suggestions:

Destructive Operations:
The partitions.sh script is highly destructive. While it has warnings, ensure you are absolutely certain about the TARGET_DISK before running it. Double-check device names in the live environment (lsblk).
UUID Placeholders:
The file satyanet-fallback.conf contains root=UUID=<your-root-uuid>. This must be manually updated with the correct UUID after your root partition is formatted.
Similarly, ensure the /etc/kernel/cmdline file (which will be used by your UKI preset dotfiles/linux-uki.preset) is created in the chroot environment with the correct root=UUID=... and other parameters like rootflags=subvol=@ rw.
User-Specific Details:
sessionctl.sh is hardcoded for the user nikunj.
The EFI_GUID in keytool_helper.sh is a placeholder.
mkinitcpio.conf and Encryption:
Your mkinitcpio.conf includes the sd-encrypt hook. If you don't plan on using systemd-based full-disk encryption, this hook isn't strictly necessary. If you do want encryption, your partitions.sh script would need to be modified to set up LUKS.
Pacstrap Consistency:
The example pacstrap command in README_OR_DONT.md is slightly different from the packages that would be installed by pacstrapper.sh (e.g., the script includes more nvidia related packages). The script is likely more up-to-date.
efibootmgr_helper.sh - bootctl status:
The bootctl status command is commented out. You might want to make this a callable function, e.g., bootctl_status, similar to other commands in the script.
Kernel Command Line for UKI:
Remember to create /etc/kernel/cmdline inside the chroot. For your NVIDIA hybrid setup, consider adding nvidia-drm.modeset=1 to this file, along with quiet splash if desired. Example for /etc/kernel/cmdline: root=UUID=YOUR_ROOT_PARTITION_UUID rootflags=subvol=@ rw quiet splash nvidia-drm.modeset=1
